    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to produce an analytical model that displays parameters to
        complement decision making when it comes to investing in home real estate.
        It evaluates a city's rent ratio traits and monitors the response or the trigger for rent
        ratio movement, driven by average city home values and home sales counts. The idea is for
        real estate investors to be ahead of the gentrification process of a metropolitan area of
        interest, before it actually has happened or in its beginning phases. Getting the information
        early will ultimately lead to higher ROIs and sound real estate investing. The information
        provided from this project could benefit those who are looking to rent or purchase the first
        home purchase that theyâ€™ll occupy, to supply a reference on how rent and home purchasing trends
        have been doing and forecasted for. Ushering the recommendations stated above to make this
        project more robust and impactful, this project hopefully provides a solid initial process to
        provide its intent.
